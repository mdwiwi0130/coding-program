## Robot Instructions
### 描述

You have a robot standing on the origin of x axis.
The robot will be given some instructions.
Your task is to predict its position after executing all the instructions.

•LEFT: move one unit left (decrease p by 1, where p is the position of the robot before moving)

•RIGHT: move one unit right (increase p by 1)

•SAME AS i: perform the same action as in the i-th instruction. It is guaranteed that i is a positive integer not greater than the number of instructions before this.


### 輸入
The first line contains the number of test cases T (T ≤ 100).
Each test case begins with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of instructions.
Each of the following n lines contains an instruction.

### 輸出
For each test case, print the final position of the robot.
Note that after processing each test case, the robot should be reset to the origin.
